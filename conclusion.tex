We propose JRRELP, a novel framework that improves upon existing relation extraction approaches by leveraging insights from the complementary problem of knowledge graph link prediction. JRRELP bridges these two tasks through an abstract multi-task learning framework that jointly learns RE and KGLP problems by unconstrained parameter sharing. We exhibit this generality be extending three diverse relation extraction methods, and improve their performance. Specifically, JRRELP enhanced methods match or exceed more complex relation extraction models, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.

% empirically demonstrating that the performance ceiling of existing work is higher than reported. 

% Moreover, we exhibit our framework's flexibility by extending two diverse sequence-based and graph-based relation extraction methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.
